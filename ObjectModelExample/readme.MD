# Object Modelling example

Designing your object graph is important to make efficient usage of your data.

With this Book store example, you can think about the following aspects

- References between the instances (where, bidirectional, ...)
- Accessing the data (indexing, quickly find the data)
- Structure access to historical data.
- Required data (like ids)
